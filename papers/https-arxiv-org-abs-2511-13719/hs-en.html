      <h1>How AI Reads Complex Documents: Doc-Researcher</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Most AI systems only "read" text. Doc-Researcher is a new system that actually understands charts, tables, and layouts like a human expert does.</p>

      <h2>The "Wall" for Traditional AI</h2>
      <p>Imagine asking an AI to analyze a 50-page financial report or a scientific paper. Most current AIs can grab the text, but they get confused by complex layout diagrams, math equations, or data hidden in tables. They treat everything like a flat block of words, missing the "visual language" of the document.</p>
      <div class="callout">The Gap: AI has been "blind" to the visual structure and multimodal data (images + text) inside documents.</div>

      <h2>The Doc-Researcher Solution</h2>
      <p>The researchers created a three-step brain for the AI:</p>
      <div class="highlight-row">
        <div class="highlight-card">
          <strong>1. Smart Parsing</strong>
          <div>It doesn't just copy text; it sees where every chart and table is, preserving its meaning.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card">
          <strong>2. Hybrid Search</strong>
          <div>It can look for things by text descriptions or by visual looks, picking the best way to find evidence.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card">
          <strong>3. Teamwork Agents</strong>
          <div>Instead of one try, it uses several "AI agents" that brainstorm, look for more clues, and combine them into a final answer.</div>
        </div>

      <h2>Real-World Results</h2>
      <p>The team created a new test called <strong>M4DocBench</strong>. It has 158 very hard questions that requires "jumping" between different documents and looking at pictures to find the answer.</p>
      <div class="callout">Doc-Researcher got 50.6% accuracy, which is 3.4 times better than previous top-tier AI systems!</div>
